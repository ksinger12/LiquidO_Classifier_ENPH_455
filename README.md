# LiquidO_Classifier_ENPH_455
Electron, gamma ray, and positron classifier based on light images from LiquidO detector.

## Initial Tests
The initial algorithm will be written using a build in neural network from PyTorch (python library). Once this has been implemented, a self-reliant one will be implemented.
